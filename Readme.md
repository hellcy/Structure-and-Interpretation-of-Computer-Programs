This repository is created to put all my exercises and notes for the textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

All work is done using my macbook.

Scheme is installed from this website: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12322434/how-to-install-mit-scheme-on-mac/31601331#31601331

Scheme can also be run from Command Line.

Another great repository with almost all exercises answers is provided here: https://github.com/numbbbbb/sicp
